(i) Choice of BLAST Program

Since we are comparing protein sequences between human and mouse, 
the appropriate BLAST program to use is blastp. This program is 
designed specifically for protein-protein alignments. 
In this case, blastp allows us to find similar or homologous protein 
sequences in the mouse database (mouse.fa) for each human protein 
sequence in human.fa.

blastn (for nucleotide sequences) or tblastn (for translating 
nucleotide sequences to compare with proteins) are other options.



(ii) Choice of Substitution Matrix

The default substitution matrix for blastp is BLOSUM, which is
a common and generally effective choice for protein-protein comparisons.
Other substitution matrices, like PAM matrices, could also be used,
but BLOSUM is standard for BLAST searches involving proteins with 
moderate similarity, making it a sensible choice here.



(iii) Choice of Parameters

-db mouse_db: Specifies the mouse protein database. This parameter directs BLAST to s
earch against the mouse proteins to find homologous sequences.

-query temp_query_file: This points to the temporary FASTA file containing one sequence from 
human.fa. 

-outfmt 5: This sets the output format to XML. XML format (option 5) is chosen
because it is structured and compatible with Biopythonâ€™s NCBIXML parser, allowing 
us to easily parse the results programmatically.

-max_target_seqs 1: This limits the output to the top alignment (best match) for 
each query. By setting it to 1, we only retrieve the most homologous sequence in 
the mouse database for each human sequence. This is efficient, as it avoids 
processing all potential matches and focuses only on the most relevant hit.
